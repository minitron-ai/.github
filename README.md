# 🤖 Minitron AI

**Minitron AI** is an open-source robotics intelligence organization focused on building **deployable, learning, and evolving robotic systems**.

Minitron explores intelligence beyond static inference — emphasizing **continuous learning, adaptation, and evolution** in real-world and simulated environments.

The project is designed for researchers, builders, and engineers working on **embodied intelligence**, **robotic control**, and **adaptive systems**.

---

## 🎯 Mission

To build open, modular robotics intelligence that:
- Learns from interaction
- Adapts behavior over time
- Evolves decision policies
- Deploys reliably on real hardware

Minitron prioritizes **long-term intelligence** over short-term benchmarks.

## 🧠 What We Build

### 🤖 Minitron Models
Core robotics intelligence models designed for embodied learning.

- **`minitron-core`**  
  Core learning and inference primitives

- **`minitron-learn`**  
  Online & offline learning pipelines

- **`minitron-evolve`**  
  Policy evolution and adaptation mechanisms

- **`minitron-sim`**  
  Simulation environments and training harnesses

- **`minitron-edge`**  
  Edge-deployable runtimes for constrained hardware

---

## 🧩 Core Principles

- **Learning-first architecture**  
- **Environment-aware memory**
- **Policy evolution, not static models**
- **Simulation ↔ real-world transfer**
- **Deployment over demos**

---

## 🛠 Technical Focus

- Embodied decision-making
- Reinforcement & hybrid learning
- Memory-augmented policies
- Continual adaptation
- Edge & robotics deployment

Minitron is framework-agnostic and designed to integrate with existing robotics stacks.
